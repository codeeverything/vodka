			<keywords>TV Licence, information, answers, expiry, end</keywords>
			<description>TV Licences expire at the end of the month and your licence starts on the day you buy it. For example, if you buy a licence today it will cover you for up to 12 months - the rest of this month and 11 months after that. Then if you renew your licence on time next year it will run for a full year. If you renew late it may not last a full 12 months.</description>
